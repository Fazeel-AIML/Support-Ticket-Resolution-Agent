    "content": "Dear [Customer],\n\nThank you for reaching out to us about the login issue you're experiencing. I'm here to help you resolve this problem as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nTo better assist you, I would like to try a few troubleshooting steps. Firstly, could you please try clearing your browser's cache and cookies? This is a common solution that often resolves login issues. If you're unsure how to do this, I can provide you with instructions.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to inform you that our API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute. If you're experiencing frequent login attempts, it may be reaching this limit, causing the issue. Please try waiting for a few minutes before attempting to log in again.\n\nLastly, please ensure that your device meets our minimum system requirements. Our mobile app requires iOS 15+ or Android 10+ to function properly.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, I'd be happy to further investigate and provide additional assistance. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you for your patience and cooperation. I'm looking forward to resolving this issue for you.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nSupport Agent",
