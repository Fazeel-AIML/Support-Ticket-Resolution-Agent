    "content": "Dear [Customer],\n\nThank you for reaching out to us about the login issue you're experiencing. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and I'm here to help you resolve the problem.\n\nBefore we proceed, I'd like to suggest clearing your browser cache and cookies. This often resolves login issues and allows you to access your account successfully. If you're still having trouble, please try logging in from a different browser or device to rule out any browser-specific issues.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to inform you that our API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute. This is in place to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of our services. If you're experiencing frequent login attempts, please wait for a few minutes before trying again.\n\nRegarding the mobile app, please note that it requires iOS 15+ or Android 10+ to function properly. If you're using an older version of the operating system, you may experience compatibility issues.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide me with more details about the error message you're seeing or any other relevant information. I'll do my best to assist you in resolving the problem.\n\nThank you for your patience and cooperation. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
